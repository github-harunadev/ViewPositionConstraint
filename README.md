# ViewPositionConstraint
Very simple Unity C# script that automatically syncs avatar's view position with avatar Head bone scale.

## What does it do?
Once the constraint is activated, it will try to sync your avatar's view position property with your avatar's head bone.

## How to use?
1. Import .unitypackage to your project.
2. Find your avatar's Head bone.
3. Add View Position Constraint via "Add Component" button.
4. Make sure your current view position is well-aligned with your needs.
5. Press Activate to let it automatically configure the current offset & activate.
6. You're now free to scale up/down the head bone. You can even scale up/down parent bones such as neck, chest, hips, or more.

## Requirements
- Unity 2022 3.22f1
- VRChat Avatar SDK (Use VRChat Creator Companion)
